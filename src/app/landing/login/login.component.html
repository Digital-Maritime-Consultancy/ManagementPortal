        <div class="auth-sep"><span><b>Terms of Use</b>: By applying for access to the MCP testbed, you agree not to store any personal information on the platform<br>
        such as names and email addresses. Please use generic names, such as 'John Doe' and generic email addresses<br>
        such as 'info@company.com'. It does need to be a working email address though, since access will be granted through this email address.<br>
        Furthermore, if anyone chooses to federate an identity registry into the MCP testbed, this should only contain test data - not actual personal information.<br>
        This is due to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For more information, contact the MCC secretariat.</span></div><br>
