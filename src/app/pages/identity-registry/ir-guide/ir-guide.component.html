        <p>
            MCP management portal aims to provide a front-end interface to MCP users. 
            Everything in the MCP Management Portal is centered around the organization of the logged in user.
            Every entity in the Identity Registry section, only has data for the users own organization.
            An organizationâ€™s own entities: vessels, devices, users, services and certificates are considered private and will never be shown to others.    
        </p>
        
        <p>
            User group of MIR is defined as:
