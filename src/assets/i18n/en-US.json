            "second-function": "Secondly, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): The MIR ensures that each MCP entity holds a corresponding cryptographic identity, i.e., a public / private key pair and a certificate with the public key bound to their identity.",
            "third-function": "Thirdly, the MIR provides the infrastructure for authentication, which enables authorization and secure integration of web services, based on the established internet standards (OAUTH 2.0 / OpenID Connect).",

Everything in the MCP Management Portal is centered around the organization of the logged in user. Every entity in the Identity Registry section, only has data for the users own organization. An organization’s own entities: vessels, devices, users, services are considered private and will never be shown to others. You can also issue certificates for your assets through a page for an asset."
